AWS CloudFormation is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows you to define and provision infrastructure as code. It enables you to create and manage AWS resources using templates and automation, making infrastructure deployment consistent and repeatable.

## Key Features

- **Automated Resource Provisioning:** It automates the provisioning and management of AWS resources.

- **Stack Management:** You can create, update, and delete stacks of AWS resources.

- **Resource Dependencies:** CloudFormation manages resource dependencies and ensures proper resource creation order.

- **Rollback and Drift Detection:** It supports rollback in case of errors and detects drift from the desired stack configuration.

## Use Cases

- **Infrastructure Automation:** CloudFormation is used for automating infrastructure deployment and updates.

- **Application Stacks:** Organizations use it to create and manage application stacks and environments.

- **Consistency and Version Control:** CloudFormation provides version control and consistency in infrastructure provisioning.
