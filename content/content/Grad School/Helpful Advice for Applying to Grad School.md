Applying to grad school (especially if you don't know anyone who has gone) can be an extremely stressful experience.  Through my experiences with it, here are some helpful links and tips.

## CS Specific 

- [CS Rankings](https://csrankings.org/) - Provides a way to filter down on the research you are interested in and find the schools and professors (with links to their websites) that work in those areas. 
- [CS-SOP](https://cs-sop.notion.site/cs-sop/CS-PhD-Statements-of-Purpose-df39955313834889b7ac5411c37b958d) - A site where grad students willingly provide their SOP that got them accepted and sometimes their stats and personal websites.  This can be a great way to figure out what all goes into a successful application but remember to be cautious when comparing yourself to these applicants (everyone has a different journey).  I found this article to be a helpful resource for that [Psychology Today Link](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/social-comparison-theory)!

## General

- Do not start your SOP with a story from your childhood (e.g. "my passion for science all started with winning the science fair when you were 12").  This is done by so many students and it's really not relevant to your grad school application. I have even heard of schools immediately throwing out an application when they see this. 
- Your SOP is the most important part of your application that you have full control over.  Take time to craft it and ask friends to review it for you.  Preferably start months before the due date. 
- From what I've heard it depends on the program for whether reaching out to professors through email prior to applying can help your application (in some programs the professors have less of a say then others).  If you are applying to a non-research grad program then it most definitely will not help.  
	- On the contrary, it can't really hurt you as long as you put the time into researching the professor and their work before hand and craft a well written email.   
- Letters of recommendation from academic's that you have conducted research with mean much more than industry letters or professors you took a class with. 
- Publications are a **huge plus**!  They tell the school you already know how to conduct valuable research and if you are currently in undergrad, you know how to manage your time as well!  If you have the time try and reach out to research groups in your university who you know publish frequently to see if you can join a project.
- Probably steer clear of Grad Cafe.  It will only make you more anxious.  Just submit your applications and move on with life!
