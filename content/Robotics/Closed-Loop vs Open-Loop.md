In robotics, the concepts of "closed-loop" and "open-loop" refer to different types of control systems used to manage the behavior and actions of robots. Understanding these concepts is fundamental in the field of robotics and automation.

1. **Open-Loop Control System**:
    
    - **Definition**: In an open-loop system, the control action from the controller is independent of the "output" of the system. That is, the system does not use feedback to determine if its desired goal has been reached.
    - **Characteristics**:
        - **No Feedback**: The system does not monitor or use information about the output to influence its control actions.
        - **Simplicity**: These systems are generally simpler and easier to construct.
        - **Less Accurate**: Due to the lack of feedback, open-loop systems may not be very accurate, especially in the presence of disturbances or changes in the environment.
        - **Examples**: A simple robot that moves a set distance upon receiving a command, without adjusting based on obstacles or variations in the terrain.
2. **Closed-Loop Control System**:
    
    - **Definition**: In a closed-loop system (also known as a feedback control system), the control action from the controller is dependent on the desired goal and the feedback from the output. Essentially, the system continuously monitors its output and adjusts its control actions accordingly.
    - **Characteristics**:
        - **Feedback Utilized**: The system uses feedback to compare the output with the desired outcome and adjusts accordingly.
        - **Complexity**: These systems are usually more complex due to the need for feedback mechanisms.
        - **Higher Accuracy**: Closed-loop systems are generally more accurate and can adapt to changes and disturbances in the environment.
        - **Examples**: A robotic arm that adjusts its movement in real-time based on sensor feedback to accurately position an object.
