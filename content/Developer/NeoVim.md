## Autocomplete Key-Bindings

 The key bindings for the autocomplete feature
  are defined in the mapping section of the cmp.setup function:

   • <C-k>: Select the previous suggestion in the autocomplete menu.
   • <C-j>: Select the next suggestion in the autocomplete menu.
   • <C-b>: Scroll up in the documentation window.
   • <C-f>: Scroll down in the documentation window.
   • <C-Space>: Show the autocomplete suggestions.
   • <C-e>: Close the autocomplete window.
   • <CR> (Enter key): Confirm the selected suggestion.

  So, to use the autocomplete feature, you can press <C-Space> to show the suggestions, <C-k> and <C-j> to navigate through the
  suggestions, and <CR> to confirm the selected suggestion.
