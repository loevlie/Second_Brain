1. VSCode - Do I need to say more?  The only time I prefer other editors is when:
	1. I am working with ROS2 and need to have a complicated *tmux* session (or sessions) open and edit at the same time
	2. I am working on the cloud with limited space (vscode has an ssh client but it always freezes and breaks my free-tier AWS EC2 instances).
2. [[Developer/NeoVim]] - When I am running into the issues with VSCode listed above my editor of choice would be NeoVim (I actually prefer Emacs but it's been a while since I've worked with it and LazyVim makes NeoVim setup easy).  My dot files for neovim and tmux are [here](https://github.com/loevlie/dot_files)
