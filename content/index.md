## Latest Updates

- **[GiftyAI](https://gifty.com.co/)**: My first venture as a *technical co-founder*, this company hopes to use generative AI and computer vision to improve the way we give gifts.  The start of this is personalized cards with user prompted generative images.  The next big goal is to use the newest advancements in image similarity to help people ensure they are getting the right gifts (whatever they might be).
- **[TeUAS](https://www.duality.ai/blog/kef-robotics-tethered-drones#:~:text=The%20KEF%20team%20took%20on,demonstrations%20in%20diverse%20operational%20environments.)**: Discover my recent work on improving drone hazard avoidance using deep learning.  I was the lead machine learning engineer on this project.
- **[Intro to Deep Learning and ML](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/logistic-regression-with-pytorch-3c8bbea594be)**: Check out one of my favorite tutorials I've made on deep learning - perfect for beginners!
- **[Pittsburgh Tech/Robotics Community Talk](https://xchangepgh2023.sched.com/event/1LdC7/an-interactive-exploration-of-computer-vision-for-unmanned-aerial-vehicles-uavs)**: I recently spoke at XChangeInnovation about SOTA deep learning applications for aerial autonomy.
